# 🚀 DevOps AWS for Beginners — Day 1: The Big Picture

## 👀 What is DevOps?

- DevOps is about collaboration between Developers, Testers, QA, and DevOps Engineers to deliver better software faster.
- It's a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops).
- The goal is to build, test, and deploy code efficiently and consistently.

## 🧑💻 Real-Life DevOps Workflow

1. Developers 👨💻
   - Write code for features or bug fixes.
   - Push code to a GitHub repository.

2. Testing Team 🧪
   - Pull code from GitHub.
   - Run automated/manual tests for bugs and errors.

3. QA Team ✅
   - Perform detailed quality checks.
   - Approve or reject code for deployment.

4. DevOps Engineers 🤝
   - Set up automation (CI/CD pipelines).
   - Build and deploy the application.
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) to manage servers/cloud.

5. Team Collaboration 🔄
   - Use chat tools (like Slack) for quick feedback and communication.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Journey: Code to Cloud

### 1. Coding ⌨️
- Developer writes code locally.

### 2. Push to GitHub 🚀
- Code is pushed to a shared GitHub repository for version control.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline 🛣️
- Tools detect new code.
- Pipeline steps:
  - Build: Get app ready to run.
  - Test: Run automated checks.
  - Lint/Security: Scan code for issues.

### 4. Testing & QA 🧪✅
- If tests fail, code goes back for fixing.
- If all tests pass and QA approves, move forward.

### 5. Provisioning Infrastructure 🌱
- Use Terraform scripts to create servers (VPS) in AWS.

### 6. Packaging & Building 📦
- Prepare code as Docker image, .zip, .jar etc.

### 7. Deployment 🚚
- Deploy the app on created VPS/server.
- Ansible/Kubernetes/scripts automate this process.

### 8. Monitoring & Feedback 📊
- Tools like Grafana/Prometheus monitor app health.
- Alerts sent out if there are issues.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- DevOps means team collaboration every step.
- Automation with CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code is core.
- From coding to deployment: Everything is a chain—each step matters!
